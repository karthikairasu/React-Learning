===========================================================================

1.  ### Let and Const: 

    #### let → block-scoped, can be reassigned.
    #### const → block-scoped, cannot be reassigned.
    
    TDZ- variables declared with let and const are hoist, But it is not initialized, so it lives in the TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone) not accessible until they are initialized with a value

    ``` 
    Ex: 1 [Start of block] 
        2 | 
        3 |--- TDZ begins (x is hoisted but not initialized) 
        4 |   x = 5         ❌ Error! `x` is in the Temporal Dead Zone 
        5 |   console.log(x) ❌ Never reached 
        6 |   let x         ✅ Initialization (TDZ ends here) 
        7 | 
        8 [End of block] You cannot access x on line 4 or 5.
    ```

2.  ### Arrow Functions:

    ES6, provide a concise way to write function expressions in JavaScript. They are identified by the => symbol and are used for writing shorter and more readable code.
    
    - Array methods (map, filter, reduce) - Arrow functions are perfect for array operations because they make the code short and readable.

    - Event handlers (if not relying on this) - Clean if not using this

    - Timers / callbacks - Shorter syntax

    - Anywhere you don’t need your own this(Avoiding this rebinding) - Arrow functions inherit this from their outer (lexical) scope, making them great when you want to avoid this confusion.

    ``` 
    Ex 1: const add = (a, b) => a + b;

    Ex 2: this keyword  - 
    const person = {
      talk(){
        setTimeout(() => { // arrow function don't rebind this keyword
          console.log("this", test);
        }, 1000)
      }
    } 
    
    ```

3.  ### Destructuring:
   
    Extract values from arrays or objects easily.

    ```
    Ex : const address = {
         street : "",
         city: "",
         country: ""
        }

        normal - const street = address.street; 
        short  - const { street, city, country } = address; // destructuring syntax
               - const { street: st } = address;            // new const st
    ```
   
    **[⬆ Back to Top](#es6-features)**

4.  ### Spread/rest Operators
    
    #### Spread 
    The JavaScript spread operator ( ... ) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object. denoted by three dots `...`

    ```
    Ex: 1.Array :
        const first = [1, 2, 3];
        const second = [4, 5, 6];

        const combinedOld = first.concat(second);             //concat method
        const combinedSpd = [...first, 'a', ...second, 'b'];  // Spread Operator 

        2.Object :

        const first = { name: "karthi" };
        const second = { job: "Engineer" };

        const combined = {...first, ...second, location: 'bangalore'};
    ```
    #### Rest
    The rest operator in JavaScript, denoted by three dots (...), allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array. It is used in function parameters and must be the last parameter in the list. The rest operator collects all the remaining arguments passed to a function and bundles them into an array, making it easier to handle variable-length argument lists.

    ```
    Ex: function myBio(...details) {
        console.log(details); // array 
        }

        myBio("John", "Doe", "Web Developer", 30, "New York");
    ```

5.  ### Template Literals
    
    Use backticks for string interpolation.

    ```
    Ex: const name = "Bob";
        const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#es6-features)**

6.  ### Promises and Async-Await
    
    #### promises
    - A Promise is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
    - It has three states: `pending, fulfilled, and rejected`.
    - Promises help write cleaner, more manageable async code, avoiding callback hell.
    - It's a way to handle async tasks like API calls, with .then() for success and .catch() for errors.
    - `This Response object represents the entire HTTP response — but not the body content itself.`
      - .json() – for JSON responses
      - .text() – for plain text
      - .blob() – for binary data
      - .formData() – for form data
      - .arrayBuffer() – for raw data
    ```
    Ex: const fetchUser = fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1");

        fetchUser
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            console.log("User Name:", data.name);
        });
        .catch( (err)=>console.error(err) )

        console.log("fetchUser:", fetchUser);
    ```
    #### Async-Await
    - `async` makes a function return a Promise.

    - `await` pauses the function until the Promise is resolved or rejected.

    - It makes asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code, improving readability. 
    ```
     Ex: // const Data = async (id) =>{}
        async function getData(id) {
        try {
            const result = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${id}`);
            const data = await result.json();
            console.log(data);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Error:", error);
        }
        }

        getData();
    ```

7.  ### Modules import-export
    
    Modules allow you to split your JavaScript code into separate files and reuse them. It helps organize and maintain code better.

    - 1. Named Export
    You can export multiple items with their names.
    You must import them using the exact same names (unless you alias).

    - 2. Default Export
    You export one default value from a module.
    You can import it with any name.

    ```
    Ex: 1. export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
           export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;
           import { add, subtract } from './math.js';

        2. export default function log(message) {
            console.log("LOG:", message);
           }
           import myLogger from './logger.js';
    ```

8.  ### Array Methods map-filter-reduce
    
    #### Map 
    Transforms each element of the array and returns a new array of the same length.
    ```
    Ex: const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
        const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
        console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6]
    ```
    #### Filter
    Filters elements based on a condition and returns a new array with only matching items.
    ```
    Ex: const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
        const even = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
        console.log(even); // [2, 4]
    ```
    #### Reduce
    Reduces the array to a single value by accumulating results.
    ```
    Ex: const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
        const total = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
        console.log(total); // 10
    ```

9.  ### DOM Manipulation
    
    DOM (Document Object Model) Manipulation is the process of programmatically changing the structure, style, or content of a web page using JavaScript.
    The DOM is a tree-like representation of your HTML document, and JavaScript can interact with it to update:

        Elements

        Attributes

        Styles

        Text/content

        Event bindings
    ```
    Ex: document.getElementById('title');
        document.querySelector('.card');
        document.querySelectorAll('li');
    ```
