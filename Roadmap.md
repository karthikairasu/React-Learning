===========================================================================

1.  ### Let and Const: 

    #### let → block-scoped, can be reassigned.
    #### const → block-scoped, cannot be reassigned.
    
    TDZ- variables declared with let and const are hoist, But it is not initialized, so it lives in the TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone) not accessible until they are initialized with a value

    ``` 
    Ex: 1 [Start of block] 
        2 | 
        3 |--- TDZ begins (x is hoisted but not initialized) 
        4 |   x = 5         ❌ Error! `x` is in the Temporal Dead Zone 
        5 |   console.log(x) ❌ Never reached 
        6 |   let x         ✅ Initialization (TDZ ends here) 
        7 | 
        8 [End of block] You cannot access x on line 4 or 5.
    ```

2.  ### Arrow Functions:

    ES6, provide a concise way to write function expressions in JavaScript. They are identified by the => symbol and are used for writing shorter and more readable code.
    
    - Array methods (map, filter, reduce) - Arrow functions are perfect for array operations because they make the code short and readable.

    - Event handlers (if not relying on this) - Clean if not using this

    - Timers / callbacks - Shorter syntax

    - Anywhere you don’t need your own this(Avoiding this rebinding) - Arrow functions inherit this from their outer (lexical) scope, making them great when you want to avoid this confusion.

    ``` 
    Ex 1: const add = (a, b) => a + b;

    Ex 2: this keyword  - 
    const person = {
      talk(){
        setTimeout(() => { // arrow function don't rebind this keyword
          console.log("this", test);
        }, 1000)
      }
    } 
    
    ```

3.  ### Destructuring:
   
    Extract values from arrays or objects easily.

    ```
    Ex : const address = {
         street : "",
         city: "",
         country: ""
        }

        normal - const street = address.street; 
        short  - const { street, city, country } = address; // destructuring syntax
               - const { street: st } = address;            // new const st
    ```
   
    **[⬆ Back to Top](#es6-features)**

4.  ### Spread/rest Operators
    
    #### Spread 
    The JavaScript spread operator ( ... ) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object. denoted by three dots `...`

    ```
    Ex: 1.Array :
        const first = [1, 2, 3];
        const second = [4, 5, 6];

        const combinedOld = first.concat(second);             //concat method
        const combinedSpd = [...first, 'a', ...second, 'b'];  // Spread Operator 

        2.Object :

        const first = { name: "karthi" };
        const second = { job: "Engineer" };

        const combined = {...first, ...second, location: 'bangalore'};
    ```
    #### Rest
    The rest operator in JavaScript, denoted by three dots (...), allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array. It is used in function parameters and must be the last parameter in the list. The rest operator collects all the remaining arguments passed to a function and bundles them into an array, making it easier to handle variable-length argument lists.

    ```
    Ex: function myBio(...details) {
        console.log(details); // array 
        }

        myBio("John", "Doe", "Web Developer", 30, "New York");
    ```

5.  ### Template Literals
    
    Use backticks for string interpolation.

    ```
    Ex: const name = "Bob";
        const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#es6-features)**

6.  ### Promises and Async-Await
    
    #### promises
    - A Promise is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
    - It has three states: `pending, fulfilled, and rejected`.
    - Promises help write cleaner, more manageable async code, avoiding callback hell.
    - It's a way to handle async tasks like API calls, with .then() for success and .catch() for errors.
    - `This Response object represents the entire HTTP response — but not the body content itself.`
      - .json() – for JSON responses
      - .text() – for plain text
      - .blob() – for binary data
      - .formData() – for form data
      - .arrayBuffer() – for raw data
    ```
    Ex: const fetchUser = fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1");

        fetchUser
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            console.log("User Name:", data.name);
        });
        .catch( (err)=>console.error(err) )

        console.log("fetchUser:", fetchUser);
    ```
    #### Async-Await
    - `async` makes a function return a Promise.

    - `await` pauses the function until the Promise is resolved or rejected.

    - It makes asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code, improving readability. 
    ```
     Ex: // const Data = async (id) =>{}
        async function getData(id) {
        try {
            const result = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${id}`);
            const data = await result.json();
            console.log(data);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Error:", error);
        }
        }

        getData();
    ```

7.  ### Modules import-export
    
    Modules allow you to split your JavaScript code into separate files and reuse them. It helps organize and maintain code better.

    - 1. Named Export
    You can export multiple items with their names.
    You must import them using the exact same names (unless you alias).

    - 2. Default Export
    You export one default value from a module.
    You can import it with any name.

    ```
    Ex: 1. export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
           export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;
           import { add, subtract } from './math.js';

        2. export default function log(message) {
            console.log("LOG:", message);
           }
           import myLogger from './logger.js';
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#es6-features)**

8.  ### Array Methods map-filter-reduce
    
    #### Map 
    Transforms each element of the array and returns a new array of the same length.
    ```
    Ex: const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
        const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
        console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6]
    ```
    #### Filter
    Filters elements based on a condition and returns a new array with only matching items.
    ```
    Ex: const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
        const even = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
        console.log(even); // [2, 4]
    ```
    #### Reduce
    Reduces the array to a single value by accumulating results.
    ```
    Ex: const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
        const total = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
        console.log(total); // 10
    ```

9.  ### DOM Manipulation
    
    DOM (Document Object Model) Manipulation is the process of programmatically changing the structure, style, or content of a web page using JavaScript.
    The DOM is a tree-like representation of your HTML document, and JavaScript can interact with it to update:

       1. Elements

       2. Attributes

       3. Styles

       4. Text/content

       5. Event bindings
    ```
    Ex: document.getElementById('title');
        document.querySelector('.card');
        document.querySelectorAll('li');
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#es6-features)**

10. ### Event Handling
    
    Event handling is the mechanism that allows you to capture and respond to user interactions like clicks, key presses, mouse movements, and more.

    #### Event Propagation Phases in JavaScript
    - Capture Phase – Event moves from the root down to the target.

    - Target Phase – Event reaches the actual element clicked.

    - Bubble Phase – Event moves from the target back up to the root.
     
    1. Prevent Default Behavior
       - Some elements (like `<a>` or `<form>`) have default actions. You can cancel them
            ```
            Ex:
            <form id="myForm">
                <label for="name">Name:</label>
                <input type="text" name="name" id="name" required>
                <button type="submit">Submit</button>
            </form> 
            document.querySelector("form").addEventListener("submit", function(e) {
                e.preventDefault(); // Stops the page from reloading
                alert("Form submitted!");
            });
            ```
    2. Stop Event Propagation
       - You can stop the event from moving up the DOM tree:
            ```
            Ex:
            <div class="container">
                Container
                <div class="box">Box (Click me!)</div>
            </div>
            document.querySelector(".container").addEventListener("click", function() {
                alert("Container clicked!");
            });

            document.querySelector(".box").addEventListener("click", function(e) {
                e.stopPropagation(); // Stops the click from reaching the container
                alert("Box clicked!");
            });
            ```
    3. Remove Event Listener
        ```
        Ex:
        function handleClick() {
            alert("Clicked once!");
            button.removeEventListener("click", handleClick); // remove after first click
        }

        const button = document.querySelector("#btn");
        button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
    
    **[⬆ Back to Top](#es6-features)**

11. ### Closures and Scope
    
    A closure is a function that remembers variables from its outer scope even after the outer function is has finished executing.
    ```
    Ex: function outer() {
            let count = 0;
            return function inner() {
                count++;
                console.log(count);
            };
        }
        const counter = outer();
        counter(); // 1
        counter(); // 2
    ```

    
    **[⬆ Back to Top](#es6-features)**

12. ### `this` Keyword
    
    - The this keyword in JavaScript refers to the object that is executing the current function.
    - Its value is determined at runtime, depending on how and where the function is called.
    - ES6 introduced arrow functions, which change the behavior of this compared to traditional functions.
    
    1. Global Context - In the global scope, this refers to the global object.
        ```
        console.log(this); // In browsers, this === window
        ```
    2. Object Methods - When a function is called as a method of an object, this refers to the object.
        ```
        const obj = {
            name: 'John',
            sayName: function() {
                console.log(this.name); // 'John'
            }
        };
        obj.sayName();
        ``` 
    3. Regular Functions - In a standalone regular function (not inside an object), this refers to the global object (or undefined in strict mode).
        ```
        function show() {
            console.log(this); // window or undefined in strict mode
        }
        show();
        ```
    4. Arrow Functions (ES6 Feature) - Arrow functions do not have their own this.They inherit this from their surrounding lexical scope.
        ```
        const obj = {
        name: 'Sam',
        greet: function() {
            const arrow = () => {
            console.log(this.name); // 'Sam'
            };
            arrow();
        }
        };
        obj.greet();
        ```
    5. In Classes (ES6 Feature) - Inside a class method, this refers to the class instance.
        ```
        class User {
        constructor(name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        sayHello() {
            console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
        }
        }

        const u = new User('Mike');
        u.sayHello(); // Hello, Mike
        ```
